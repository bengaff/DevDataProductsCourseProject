## Overview:
This repo contains the server.R and ui.R files that were used to create my Campaign Significance! shiny application. I have also included the customised bootstrap.css file that was used to modify the format of the application. 

- The shiny application can be seen at: http://bengaff.shinyapps.io/TryFINAL  
- A pitch presentation for the app is at: http://bengaff.github.io/CampaignSignificancePitch/
